# price-optimization-demand-elasticity
This project uses historical sales data to build models predicting demand based on pricing changes. Features include sales forecasting, price elasticity analysis, and an interactive Streamlit website for visualizing optimization results.

**Price Optimization and Demand Elasticity** is a powerful area of machine learning and data science that helps businesses understand how changes in price affect demand for their products. Here’s a more detailed look at this project, including its objectives, methodologies, and potential outcomes:

1. Project Overview
Objective: To determine how different pricing strategies influence the demand for products, and to find the optimal price points that maximize revenue or profit.

Application: Retailers can use this information to adjust their pricing strategies to boost sales and improve profitability. This is particularly useful in competitive markets where pricing flexibility can be a significant advantage.

2. Key Concepts
Price Elasticity of Demand: This measures how sensitive the quantity demanded of a product is to changes in its price. If a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded, the product is said to be highly elastic. Conversely, if the quantity demanded doesn’t change much with price changes, the product is inelastic.

Demand Curve: A graphical representation showing the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity demanded. Analyzing this curve helps in understanding how price changes affect demand.

Optimal Pricing: The price point that maximizes revenue or profit, taking into account demand elasticity and cost structure.

3. Steps to Implement
Data Preparation
Data Collection: Gather historical sales data, including:

Product Data: Product ID, category, and description.
Pricing Data: Historical prices, discounts, and promotions.
Sales Data: Sales volume, revenue, and transaction details.
External Factors (if available): Seasonality, holidays, weather, and economic conditions.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Normalize pricing and sales data for analysis.
Feature Engineering:

Create features that capture historical pricing strategies and their effects on sales.
Include time-based features such as day of the week, month, and year to account for seasonality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize Demand vs. Price:

Plot sales volume against prices to visualize the demand curve.
Use scatter plots or line graphs to understand trends and patterns.
Calculate Elasticity:

Use statistical methods to estimate the price elasticity of demand. This often involves regression analysis.
Modeling
Price Elasticity Model:

Linear Regression: Model the relationship between price and sales volume.
Log-Log Model: Use logarithmic transformation of price and quantity for better elasticity estimation.
Demand Forecasting:

Regression Models: Predict future demand based on historical pricing data.
Time-Series Analysis: Use methods like ARIMA or Prophet for forecasting demand trends.
Optimization:

Revenue Maximization: Formulate an optimization problem where you maximize revenue based on price elasticity estimates.

Profit Maximization: Incorporate cost data to optimize for profit, considering both price elasticity and cost of goods sold.

Techniques:

Linear Programming: For optimization problems involving constraints.
Dynamic Pricing Algorithms: Adjust prices in real-time based on demand predictions and market conditions.
Implementation
Create a Model Pipeline:

Develop a pipeline that takes in pricing data and forecasts demand and revenue based on different price points.
Automate the process to adjust prices dynamically based on real-time data.
Deployment:

Build a Streamlit application or dashboard to allow users to input various pricing scenarios and see potential impacts on demand and revenue.
Validation and Testing:

Validate the model using historical data and back-test pricing strategies.
Monitor performance and adjust the model as necessary based on new data.
Evaluation
Accuracy Metrics:

Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for demand forecasting.
Evaluate the effectiveness of pricing strategies through simulations and A/B testing.
Real-World Impact:

Analyze how well the optimized pricing strategy performs in practice.
Measure the financial impact of price changes on revenue and profitability.
4. Tools and Technologies
Data Handling: Python libraries like pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Modeling: Scikit-learn for regression models, Statsmodels for elasticity estimation, and TensorFlow/PyTorch for advanced models.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for plotting demand curves and analysis results.
Optimization: Libraries like SciPy for optimization algorithms and linear programming.
Deployment: Streamlit or Flask for creating a web-based application to interact with the model.
5. Example Use Case
Suppose a liquor store wants to determine the optimal price for a popular brand of whiskey to maximize revenue. Using historical sales data and price elasticity models, the store can predict how changes in price will affect sales volume. By applying optimization techniques, the store can find the price point that maximizes revenue, helping them set competitive prices and improve profitability.

This project will provide valuable insights into pricing strategies and demand management, offering a practical application of machine learning in the retail sector.
