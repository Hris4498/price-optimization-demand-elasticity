# price-optimization-demand-elasticity
This project uses historical sales data to build models predicting demand based on pricing changes. Features include sales forecasting, price elasticity analysis, and an interactive Streamlit website for visualizing optimization results.

**Price Optimization and Demand Elasticity** is a powerful area of machine learning and data science that helps businesses understand how changes in price affect demand for their products. Here’s a more detailed look at this project, including its objectives, methodologies, and potential outcomes:

1. Project Overview
Objective: To determine how different pricing strategies influence the demand for products, and to find the optimal price points that maximize revenue or profit.

Application: Retailers can use this information to adjust their pricing strategies to boost sales and improve profitability. This is particularly useful in competitive markets where pricing flexibility can be a significant advantage.

2. Key Concepts
Price Elasticity of Demand: This measures how sensitive the quantity demanded of a product is to changes in its price. If a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded, the product is said to be highly elastic. Conversely, if the quantity demanded doesn’t change much with price changes, the product is inelastic.

Demand Curve: A graphical representation showing the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity demanded. Analyzing this curve helps in understanding how price changes affect demand.

Optimal Pricing: The price point that maximizes revenue or profit, taking into account demand elasticity and cost structure.
